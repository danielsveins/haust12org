The Idea has surfaced to provide GOL with many different species/colors
perhaps a rule could be:

  4-same type/species/nation changes adjacent to that nation  -> problematic
  
  Firstly:
  a square with cell of other type counts toward overcrowding..
 
  3 or 2 switches color..


  Possibly:
  
  first check cell -> if it has neigbors of other type, the most numorous type becomes the type of the cell.
