Python notes

current posish: bls. 197-198

In python3 Functions can see global variables and make use of their values,
but they cannot alter global variables only call by value, and return things.
  Functions can take arguments, the variables inside the local scope of the 
functions are called parameters, but the values taken into these variables
are called arguments.


A function definition must come before the function is called.


Making a Matrix in Python:

#This makes a 100X100 matrix with numbers in it 
list100 = list(range(0,100))
MatrixC = []
for x in range(0,100): MatrixC.append(list100)
