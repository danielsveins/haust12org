208-universities and large businesses. When the third edition appeared in 1996, computer
209-networks, especially the Internet, had become a daily reality for millions of people. The new
210-item in the fourth edition is the rapid growth of wireless networking in many forms.
211-The networking picture has changed radically since the third edition. In the mid-1990s,
212-numerous kinds of LANs and WANs existed, along with multiple protocol stacks. By 2003, the
213-only wired LAN in widespread use was Ethernet, and virtually all WANs were on the Internet.
214-Accordingly, a large amount of material about these older networks has been removed.
215-However, new developments are also plentiful. The most important is the huge increase in
216:wireless networks, including 802.11, wireless local loops, 2G and 3G cellular networks,
217-Bluetooth, WAP, i-mode, and others. Accordingly, a large amount of material has been added
218-on wireless networks. Another newly-important topic is security, so a whole chapter on it has
219-been added.
220-Although Chap. 1 has the same introductory function as it did in the third edition, the contents
221-have been revised and brought up to date. For example, introductions to the Internet,
222-Ethernet, and wireless LANs are given there, along with some history and background. Home
223-networking is also discussed briefly.
224-Chapter 2 has been reorganized somewhat. After a brief introduction to the principles of data

923-The next step up in wireless networking are the wireless LANs. These are systems in which every computer has
924-a radio modem and antenna with which it can communicate with other systems. Often there is an antenna on the
925-ceiling that the machines talk to, as shown in Fig. 1-11(b). However, if the systems are close enough, they can
926-communicate directly with one another in a peer-to-peer configuration. Wireless LANs are becoming increasingly
927-common in small offices and homes, where installing Ethernet is considered too much trouble, as well as in older
928-office buildings, company cafeterias, conference rooms, and other places. There is a standard for wireless LANs,
929:called IEEE 802.11, which most systems implement and which is becoming very widespread. We will discuss it
930-in Chap. 4.
931-The third kind of wireless network is used in wide area systems. The radio network used for cellular telephones
932-is an example of a low-bandwidth wireless system. This system has already gone through three generations.
933-The first generation was analog and for voice only. The second generation was digital and for voice only. The
934-third generation is digital and is for both voice and data. In a certain sense, cellular wireless networks are like
935-wireless LANs, except that the distances involved are much greater and the bit rates much lower. Wireless LANs
936-can operate at rates up to about 50 Mbps over distances of tens of meters. Cellular systems operate below 1
937-Mbps, but the distance between the base station and the computer or telephone is measured in kilometers

1696-
1697-1.5 Example Networks
1698-The subject of computer networking covers many different kinds of networks, large and small, well known and
1699-less well known. They have different goals, scales, and technologies. In the following sections, we will look at
1700-some examples, to get an idea of the variety one finds in the area of computer networking.
1701-We will start with the Internet, probably the best known network, and look at its history, evolution, and
1702-technology. Then we will consider ATM, which is often used within the core of large (telephone) networks.
1703-Technically, it is quite different from the Internet, contrasting nicely with it. Next we will introduce Ethernet, the
1704:dominant local area network. Finally, we will look at IEEE 802.11, the standard for wireless LANs.
1705-1.5.1 The Internet
1706-The Internet is not a network at all, but a vast collection of different networks that use certain common protocols
1707-and provide certain common services. It is an unusual system in that it was not planned by anyone and is not
1708-controlled by anyone. To better understand it, let us start from the beginning and see how it has developed and
1709-why. For a wonderful history of the Internet, John Naughton's (2000) book is highly recommended. It is one of
1710-those rare books that is not only fun to read, but also has 20 pages of ibid.'s and op. cit.'s for the serious
1711-historian. Some of the material below is based on this book.
1712-Of course, countless technical books have been written about the Internet and its protocols as well. For more

2184-Similarly, IBM had its own favorite: its proprietary token ring. The token was passed around the ring and
2185-whichever computer held the token was allowed to transmit before putting the token back on the ring. Unlike
2186-802.4, this scheme, standardized as 802.5, is still in use at some IBM sites, but virtually nowhere outside of IBM
2187-sites. However, work is progressing on a gigabit version (802.5v), but it seems unlikely that it will ever catch up
2188-with Ethernet. In short, there was a war between Ethernet, token bus, and token ring, and Ethernet won, mostly
2189-because it was there first and the challengers were not as good.
2190-57
2191-
2192:1.5.4 Wireless LANs: 802.11
2193-Almost as soon as notebook computers appeared, many people had a dream of walking into an office and
2194-magically having their notebook computer be connected to the Internet. Consequently, various groups began
2195-working on ways to accomplish this goal. The most practical approach is to equip both the office and the
2196-notebook computers with short-range radio transmitters and receivers to allow them to communicate. This work
2197-rapidly led to wireless LANs being marketed by a variety of companies.
2198-The trouble was that no two of them were compatible. This proliferation of standards meant that a computer
2199-equipped with a brand X radio would not work in a room equipped with a brand Y base station. Finally, the
2200-industry decided that a wireless LAN standard might be a good idea, so the IEEE committee that standardized
2201-the wired LANs was given the task of drawing up a wireless LAN standard. The standard it came up with was
2202:named 802.11. A common slang name for it is WiFi. It is an important standard and deserves respect, so we will
2203:call it by its proper name, 802.11.
2204-The proposed standard had to work in two modes:
2205-1. In the presence of a base station.
2206-2. In the absence of a base station.
2207:In the former case, all communication was to go through the base station, called an access point in 802.11
2208-terminology. In the latter case, the computers would just send to one another directly. This mode is now
2209-sometimes called ad hoc networking. A typical example is two or more people sitting down together in a room
2210-not equipped with a wireless LAN and having their computers just communicate directly. The two modes are
2211-illustrated in Fig. 1-35.
2212-Figure 1-35. (a) Wireless networking with a base station. (b) Ad hoc networking.
2213-
2214-The first decision was the easiest: what to call it. All the other LAN standards had numbers like 802.1, 802.2,
2215:802.3, up to 802.10, so the wireless LAN standard was dubbed 802.11. The rest was harder.
2216-In particular, some of the many challenges that had to be met were: finding a suitable frequency band that was
2217-available, preferably worldwide; dealing with the fact that radio signals have a finite range; ensuring that users'
2218-privacy was maintained; taking limited battery life into account; worrying about human safety (do radio waves
2219-cause cancer?); understanding the implications of computer mobility; and finally, building a system with enough
2220-bandwidth to be economically viable.
2221-At the time the standardization process started (mid-1990s), Ethernet had already come to dominate local area
2222:networking, so the committee decided to make 802.11 compatible with Ethernet above the data link layer. In
2223-particular, it should be possible to send an IP packet over the wireless LAN the same way a wired computer sent
2224-an IP packet over Ethernet. Nevertheless, in the physical and data link layers, several inherent differences with
2225-Ethernet exist and had to be dealt with by the standard.
2226-First, a computer on Ethernet always listens to the ether before transmitting. Only if the ether is idle does the
2227-computer begin transmitting. With wireless LANs, that idea does not work so well. To see why, examine Fig. 136. Suppose that computer A is transmitting to computer B, but the radio range of A's transmitter is too short to
2228-58
2229-
2230-reach computer C. If C wants to transmit to B it can listen to the ether before starting, but the fact that it does not
2231:hear anything does not mean that its transmission will succeed. The 802.11 standard had to solve this problem.
2232-Figure 1-36. The range of a single radio may not cover the entire system.
2233-
2234-The second problem that had to be solved is that a radio signal can be reflected off solid objects, so it may be
2235-received multiple times (along multiple paths). This interference results in what is called multipath fading.
2236-The third problem is that a great deal of software is not aware of mobility. For example, many word processors
2237-have a list of printers that users can choose from to print a file. When the computer on which the word processor
2238-runs is taken into a new environment, the built-in list of printers becomes invalid.
2239-The fourth problem is that if a notebook computer is moved away from the ceiling-mounted base station it is
2240-using and into the range of a different base station, some way of handing it off is needed. Although this problem
2241-occurs with cellular telephones, it does not occur with Ethernet and needed to be solved. In particular, the
2242-network envisioned consists of multiple cells, each with its own base station, but with the base stations
2243-connected by Ethernet, as shown in Fig. 1-37. From the outside, the entire system should look like a single
2244:Ethernet. The connection between the 802.11 system and the outside world is called a portal.
2245:Figure 1-37. A multicell 802.11 network.
2246-
2247-After some work, the committee came up with a standard in 1997 that addressed these and other concerns. The
2248-wireless LAN it described ran at either 1 Mbps or 2 Mbps. Almost immediately, people complained that it was too
2249-slow, so work began on faster standards. A split developed within the committee, resulting in two new standards
2250:in 1999. The 802.11a standard uses a wider frequency band and runs at speeds up to 54 Mbps. The 802.11b
2251:standard uses the same frequency band as 802.11, but uses a different modulation technique to achieve 11
2252-Mbps. Some people see this as psychologically important since 11 Mbps is faster than the original wired
2253:Ethernet. It is likely that the original 1-Mbps 802.11 will die off quickly, but it is not yet clear which of the new
2254-standards will win out.
2255-To make matters even more complicated than they already were, the 802 committee has come up with yet
2256:another variant, 802.11g, which uses the modulation technique of 802.11a but the frequency band of 802.11b.
2257:We will come back to 802.11 in detail in Chap. 4.
2258-
2259-59
2260-
2261:That 802.11 is going to cause a revolution in computing and Internet access is now beyond any doubt. Airports,
2262-train stations, hotels, shopping malls, and universities are rapidly installing it. Even upscale coffee shops are
2263:installing 802.11 so that the assembled yuppies can surf the Web while drinking their lattes. It is likely that
2264:802.11 will do to the Internet what notebook computers did to computing: make it mobile.
2265-1.6 Network Standardization
2266-Many network vendors and suppliers exist, each with its own ideas of how things should be done. Without
2267-coordination, there would be complete chaos, and users would get nothing done. The only way out is to agree
2268-on some network standards.
2269-Not only do standards allow different computers to communicate, but they also increase the market for products
2270-adhering to the standard. A larger market leads to mass production, economies of scale in manufacturing, VLSI
2271-implementations, and other benefits that decrease price and further increase acceptance. In the following
2272-sections we will take a quick look at the important, but little-known, world of international standardization.
--
2401-NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. It used to be
2402-the National Bureau of Standards. It issues standards that are mandatory for purchases made by the U.S.
2403-Government, except for those of the Department of Defense, which has its own standards.
2404-Another major player in the standards world is IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), the
2405-largest professional organization in the world. In addition to publishing scores of journals and running hundreds
2406-of conferences each year, IEEE has a standardization group that develops standards in the area of electrical
2407-engineering and computing. IEEE's 802 committee has standardized many kinds of LANs. We will study some of
2408-its output later in this book. The actual work is done by a collection of working groups, which are listed in Fig. 138. The success rate of the various 802 working groups has been low; having an 802.x number is no guarantee
2409:of success. But the impact of the success stories (especially 802.3 and 802.11) has been enormous.

2415-The worldwide Internet has its own standardization mechanisms, very different from those of ITU-T and ISO. The
2416-difference can be crudely summed up by saying that the people who come to ITU or ISO standardization
2417-meetings wear suits. The people who come to Internet standardization meetings wear jeans (except when they

2542-connectionless or connection-oriented. Most networks support protocol hierarchies, with each layer providing
2543-services to the layers above it and insulating them from the details of the protocols used in the lower layers.
2544-Protocol stacks are typically based either on the OSI model or on the TCP/IP model. Both have network,
2545-transport, and application layers, but they differ on the other layers. Design issues include multiplexing, flow
2546-control, error control, and others. Much of this book deals with protocols and their design.
2547-Networks provide services to their users. These services can be connection-oriented or connectionless. In some
2548-networks, connectionless service is provided in one layer and connection-oriented service is provided in the
2549-layer above it.
2550:Well-known networks include the Internet, ATM networks, Ethernet, and the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN. The
2551-Internet evolved from the ARPANET, to which other networks were added to form an internetwork. The present
2552-Internet is actually a collection of many thousands of networks, rather than a single network. What characterizes
2553-it is the use of the TCP/IP protocol stack throughout. ATM is widely used inside the telephone system for longhaul data traffic. Ethernet is the most popular LAN and is present in most large companies and universities.
2554-Finally, wireless LANs at surprisingly high speeds (up to 54 Mbps) are beginning to be widely deployed.
2555-To have multiple computers talk to each other requires a large amount of standardization, both in the hardware
2556-and software. Organizations such as the ITU-T, ISO, IEEE, and IAB manage different parts of the
2557-standardization process.

2670-How long was a bit on the original 802.3 standard in meters? Use a transmission speed of 10 Mbps and
2671-assume the propagation speed in coax is 2/3 the speed of light in vacuum.
2672-An image is 1024 x 768 pixels with 3 bytes/pixel. Assume the image is uncompressed. How long does it
2673-take to transmit it over a 56-kbps modem channel? Over a 1-Mbps cable modem? Over a 10-Mbps
2674-Ethernet? Over 100-Mbps Ethernet?

2679-Ethernet? Discuss your answer.

2683-32. When a system has a permanent part and a removable part (such as a CD-ROM drive and the CDROM), it is important that the system be standardized, so that different companies can make both the
2684-permanent and removable parts and everything still works together. Give three examples outside the
2685-computer industry where such international standards exist. Now give three areas outside the computer
2686-industry where they do not exist.

3138-1) to get the best reception (many watts/Hz).
3139-Most transmissions use a narrow frequency band (i.e., Df/f
3140-However, in some cases, a wide band is used, with two variations. In frequency hopping spread spectrum, the
3141-transmitter hops from frequency to frequency hundreds of times per second. It is popular for military
3142-communication because it makes transmissions hard to detect and next to impossible to jam. It also offers good
3143-resistance to multipath fading because the direct signal always arrives at the receiver first. Reflected signals
3144-follow a longer path and arrive later. By then the receiver may have changed frequency and no longer accepts
3145-signals on the previous frequency, thus eliminating interference between the direct and reflected signals. In
3146:recent years, this technique has also been applied commercially—both 802.11 and Bluetooth use it, for example.
3147-As a curious footnote, the technique was co-invented by the Austrian-born sex goddess Hedy Lamarr, the first
3148-woman to appear nude in a motion picture (the 1933 Czech film Extase). Her first husband was an armaments
3149-manufacturer who told her how easy it was to block the radio signals then used to control torpedos. When she

3153-and fled to Hollywood to continue her career as a movie actress. In her spare time, she invented frequency
3154-hopping to help the Allied war effort. Her scheme used 88 frequencies, the number of keys (and frequencies) on

3271-Medical) bands for unlicensed usage. Garage door openers, cordless phones, radio-controlled toys, wireless
3272-mice, and numerous other wireless household devices use the ISM bands. To minimize interference between
3273-these uncoordinated devices, the FCC mandates that all devices in the ISM bands use spread spectrum
3274-techniques. Similar rules apply in other countries
3275-The location of the ISM bands varies somewhat from country to country. In the United States, for example,
3276-devices whose power is under 1 watt can use the bands shown in Fig. 2-13 without requiring a FCC license. The
3277-900-MHz band works best, but it is crowded and not available worldwide. The 2.4-GHz band is available in most
3278-countries, but it is subject to interference from microwave ovens and radar installations. Bluetooth and some of
3279:the 802.11 wireless LANs operate in this band. The 5.7-GHz band is new and relatively undeveloped, so
3280:equipment for it is expensive, but since 802.11a uses it, it will quickly become more popular.

3286-Unguided infrared and millimeter waves are widely used for short-range communication. The remote controls
3287-used on televisions, VCRs, and stereos all use infrared communication. They are relatively directional, cheap,
3288-and easy to build but have a major drawback: they do not pass through solid objects (try standing between your
--
4932-connection. Since GPRS is just an overlay over the existing voice system, it is at best a stop-gap measure until
4933-3G arrives.
4934-Even though 3G networks are not fully deployed yet, some researchers regard 3G as a done deal and thus not
4935-interesting any more. These people are already working on 4G systems (Berezdivin et al., 2002; Guo and
4936-Chaskar, 2002; Huang and Zhuang, 2002; Kellerer et al., 2002; and Misra et al., 2002). Some of the proposed
4937-features of 4G systems include high bandwidth, ubiquity (connectivity everywhere), seamless integration with
4938-wired networks and especially IP, adaptive resource and spectrum management, software radios, and high
4939-quality of service for multimedia.
4940:Then on the other hand, so many 802.11 wireless LAN access points are being set up all over the place, that
4941-some people think 3G is not only not a done deal, it is doomed. In this vision, people will just wander from one
4942:802.11 access point to another to stay connected. To say the industry is in a state of enormous flux is a huge
4943-understatement. Check back in about 5 years to see what happens.
4944-2.7 Cable Television
4945-We have now studied both the fixed and wireless telephone systems in a fair amount of detail. Both will clearly
4946-play a major role in future networks. However, an alternative available for fixed networking is now becoming a
4947-major player: cable television networks. Many people already get their telephone and Internet service over the
4948-cable, and the cable operators are actively working to increase their market share. In the following sections we
4949-will look at cable television as a networking system in more detail and contrast it with the telephone systems we
4950-have just studied. For more information about cable, see (Laubach et al., 2001; Louis, 2002; Ovadia, 2001; and

7804-
7805-4.3 Ethernet
7806-We have now finished our general discussion of channel allocation protocols in the abstract, so
7807-it is time to see how these principles apply to real systems, in particular, LANs. As discussed in
7808-Sec. 1.5.3, the IEEE has standardized a number of local area networks and metropolitan area
7809-networks under the name of IEEE 802. A few have survived but many have not, as we saw in
7810-Fig. 1-38. Some people who believe in reincarnation think that Charles Darwin came back as a
7811-member of the IEEE Standards Association to weed out the unfit. The most important of the
7812:survivors are 802.3 (Ethernet) and 802.11 (wireless LAN). With 802.15 (Bluetooth) and
7813-802.16 (wireless MAN), it is too early to tell. Please consult the 5th edition of this book to find
7814:out. Both 802.3 and 802.11 have different physical layers and different MAC sublayers but
7815-converge on the same logical link control sublayer (defined in 802.2), so they have the same
7816-interface to the network layer.
7817-We introduced Ethernet in Sec. 1.5.3 and will not repeat that material here. Instead we will
7818-focus on the technical details of Ethernet, the protocols, and recent developments in highspeed (gigabit) Ethernet. Since Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 are identical except for two minor
7819-differences that we will discuss shortly, many people use the terms ''Ethernet'' and ''IEEE
7820-802.3'' interchangeably, and we will do so, too. For more information about Ethernet, see
7821-(Breyer and Riley, 1999 ; Seifert, 1998; and Spurgeon, 2000).

8516-Ethernet, far more complex, and harder to manage. Eventually, Ethernet caught up with them
8517-in terms of speed, so they had no advantages left and quietly died off except for ATM's use
8518-deep within the core of the telephone system.
8519-
8520-4.4 Wireless LANs
8521-Although Ethernet is widely used, it is about to get some competition. Wireless LANs are
8522-increasingly popular, and more and more office buildings, airports, and other public places are
8523-being outfitted with them. Wireless LANs can operate in one of two configurations, as we saw
8524:in Fig. 1-35: with a base station and without a base station. Consequently, the 802.11 LAN
8525-standard takes this into account and makes provision for both arrangements, as we will see
8526-shortly.
8527:We gave some background information on 802.11 in Sec. 1.5.4. Now is the time to take a
8528-closer look at the technology. In the following sections we will look at the protocol stack,
8529-physical layer radio transmission techniques, MAC sublayer protocol, frame structure, and
8530:services. For more information about 802.11, see (Crow et al., 1997; Geier, 2002; Heegard et
8531-al., 2001; Kapp, 2002; O'Hara and Petrick, 1999; and Severance, 1999). To hear the truth
8532:from the mouth of the horse, consult the published 802.11 standard itself.

8536:4.4.1 The 802.11 Protocol Stack
8537-The protocols used by all the 802 variants, including Ethernet, have a certain commonality of
8538:structure. A partial view of the 802.11 protocol stack is given in Fig. 4-25. The physical layer
8539-corresponds to the OSI physical layer fairly well, but the data link layer in all the 802 protocols
8540:is split into two or more sublayers. In 802.11, the MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer
8541-determines how the channel is allocated, that is, who gets to transmit next. Above it is the LLC
8542-(Logical Link Control) sublayer, whose job it is to hide the differences between the different
8543-802 variants and make them indistinguishable as far as the network layer is concerned. We
8544-studied the LLC when examining Ethernet earlier in this chapter and will not repeat that
8545-material here.

8547:Figure 4-25. Part of the 802.11 protocol stack.
8548-
8549:The 1997 802.11 standard specifies three transmission techniques allowed in the physical
8550-layer. The infrared method uses much the same technology as television remote controls do.
8551-The other two use short-range radio, using techniques called FHSS and DSSS. Both of these
8552-use a part of the spectrum that does not require licensing (the 2.4-GHz ISM band). Radiocontrolled garage door openers also use this piece of the spectrum, so your notebook
8553-computer may find itself in competition with your garage door. Cordless telephones and
8554-microwave ovens also use this band. All of these techniques operate at 1 or 2 Mbps and at low
8555-enough power that they do not conflict too much. In 1999, two new techniques were
8556-introduced to achieve higher bandwidth. These are called OFDM and HR-DSSS. They operate at
8557-up to 54 Mbps and 11 Mbps, respectively. In 2001, a second OFDM modulation was introduced,
8558-but in a different frequency band from the first one. Now we will examine each of them briefly.
8559-Technically, these belong to the physical layer and should have been examined in Chapter 2,
8560:but since they are so closely tied to LANs in general and the 802.11 MAC sublayer, we treat
8561-them here instead.
8562-
8563:4.4.2 The 802.11 Physical Layer
8564-Each of the five permitted transmission techniques makes it possible to send a MAC frame
8565-from one station to another. They differ, however, in the technology used and speeds
8566-achievable. A detailed discussion of these technologies is far beyond the scope of this book,
8567-but a few words on each one, along with some of the key words, may provide interested
8568-readers with terms to search for on the Internet or elsewhere for more information.
8569-The infrared option uses diffused (i.e., not line of sight) transmission at 0.85 or 0.95 microns.
8570-Two speeds are permitted: 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps. At 1 Mbps, an encoding scheme is used in
8571-which a group of 4 bits is encoded as a 16-bit codeword containing fifteen 0s and a single 1,
--
8590-building-to-building links. Its main disadvantage is its low bandwidth.
8591-The third modulation method, DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum), is also restricted
8592-to 1 or 2 Mbps. The scheme used has some similarities to the CDMA system we examined in
8593-Sec. 2.6.2, but differs in other ways. Each bit is transmitted as 11 chips, using what is called a
8594-Barker sequence. It uses phase shift modulation at 1 Mbaud, transmitting 1 bit per baud
8595-when operating at 1 Mbps and 2 bits per baud when operating at 2 Mbps. For years, the FCC
8596-required all wireless communications equipment operating in the ISM bands in the U.S. to use
8597-spread spectrum, but in May 2002, that rule was dropped as new technologies emerged.
8598:The first of the high-speed wireless LANs, 802.11a, uses OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency
8599-Division Multiplexing) to deliver up to 54 Mbps in the wider 5-GHz ISM band. As the term
8600-FDM suggests, different frequencies are used—52 of them, 48 for data and 4 for
8601-synchronization—not unlike ADSL. Since transmissions are present on multiple frequencies at
8602-the same time, this technique is considered a form of spread spectrum, but different from both
8603-CDMA and FHSS. Splitting the signal into many narrow bands has some key advantages over
8604-using a single wide band, including better immunity to narrowband interference and the
8605-possibility of using noncontiguous bands. A complex encoding system is used, based on phaseshift modulation for speeds up to 18 Mbps and on QAM above that. At 54 Mbps, 216 data bits
8606-are encoded into 288-bit symbols. Part of the motivation for OFDM is compatibility with the
8607-European HiperLAN/2 system (Doufexi et al., 2002). The technique has a good spectrum
8608-efficiency in terms of bits/Hz and good immunity to multipath fading.
8609-Next, we come to HR-DSSS (High Rate Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum), another
8610-spread spectrum technique, which uses 11 million chips/sec to achieve 11 Mbps in the 2.4-GHz
8611:band. It is called 802.11b but is not a follow-up to 802.11a. In fact, its standard was
8612:approved first and it got to market first. Data rates supported by 802.11b are 1, 2, 5.5, and 11
8613-Mbps. The two slow rates run at 1 Mbaud, with 1 and 2 bits per baud, respectively, using
8614-phase shift modulation (for compatibility with DSSS). The two faster rates run at 1.375 Mbaud,
8615-with 4 and 8 bits per baud, respectively, using Walsh/Hadamard codes. The data rate may
8616-be dynamically adapted during operation to achieve the optimum speed possible under current
8617:conditions of load and noise. In practice, the operating speed of 802.11b is nearly always 11
8618:Mbps. Although 802.11b is slower than 802.11a, its range is about 7 times greater, which is
8619-more important in many situations.
8620:An enhanced version of 802.11b, 802.11g, was approved by IEEE in November 2001 after
8621-much politicking about whose patented technology it would use. It uses the OFDM modulation
8622:method of 802.11a but operates in the narrow 2.4-GHz ISM band along with 802.11b. In
8623-theory it can operate at up to 54 MBps. It is not yet clear whether this speed will be realized in
8624:practice. What it does mean is that the 802.11 committee has produced three different highspeed wireless LANs: 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g (not to mention three low-speed
8625-221
8626-
8627-wireless LANs). One can legitimately ask if this is a good thing for a standards committee to
8628-do. Maybe three was their lucky number.
8629-
8630:4.4.3 The 802.11 MAC Sublayer Protocol
8631-Let us now return from the land of electrical engineering to the land of computer science. The
8632:802.11 MAC sublayer protocol is quite different from that of Ethernet due to the inherent
8633-complexity of the wireless environment compared to that of a wired system. With Ethernet, a
8634-station just waits until the ether goes silent and starts transmitting. If it does not receive a
8635-noise burst back within the first 64 bytes, the frame has almost assuredly been delivered
8636-correctly. With wireless, this situation does not hold.
8637-To start with, there is the hidden station problem mentioned earlier and illustrated again in Fig.
8638-4-26(a). Since not all stations are within radio range of each other, transmissions going on in
8639-one part of a cell may not be received elsewhere in the same cell. In this example, station C is
8640-transmitting to station B. If A senses the channel, it will not hear anything and falsely conclude
8641-that it may now start transmitting to B.
8642-
8643-Figure 4-26. (a) The hidden station problem. (b) The exposed station
8644-problem.
8645-
8646-In addition, there is the inverse problem, the exposed station problem, illustrated in Fig. 426(b). Here B wants to send to C so it listens to the channel. When it hears a transmission, it
8647-falsely concludes that it may not send to C, even though A may be transmitting to D (not
8648-shown). In addition, most radios are half duplex, meaning that they cannot transmit and listen
8649:for noise bursts at the same time on a single frequency. As a result of these problems, 802.11
8650-does not use CSMA/CD, as Ethernet does.
8651:To deal with this problem, 802.11 supports two modes of operation. The first, called DCF
8652-(Distributed Coordination Function), does not use any kind of central control (in that
8653-respect, similar to Ethernet). The other, called PCF (Point Coordination Function), uses the
8654-base station to control all activity in its cell. All implementations must support DCF but PCF is
8655-optional. We will now discuss these two modes in turn.
8656:When DCF is employed, 802.11 uses a protocol called CSMA/CA (CSMA with Collision
8657-Avoidance). In this protocol, both physical channel sensing and virtual channel sensing are
8658-used. Two methods of operation are supported by CSMA/CA. In the first method, when a
8659-station wants to transmit, it senses the channel. If it is idle, it just starts transmitting. It does
8660-not sense the channel while transmitting but emits its entire frame, which may well be
8661-destroyed at the receiver due to interference there. If the channel is busy, the sender defers
8662-until it goes idle and then starts transmitting. If a collision occurs, the colliding stations wait a
8663-
8664-222
--
8691-probability of a frame making it through successfully decreases with frame length. If the
8692-probability of any bit being in error is p, then the probability of an n-bit frame being received
8693-entirely correctly is (1 - p)n. For example, for p = 10-4, the probability of receiving a full
8694-Ethernet frame (12,144 bits) correctly is less than 30%. If p = 10-5, about one frame in 9 will
8695-be damaged. Even if p = 10-6, over 1% of the frames will be damaged, which amounts to
8696-almost a dozen per second, and more if frames shorter than the maximum are used. In
8697-summary, if a frame is too long, it has very little chance of getting through undamaged and
8698-will probably have to be retransmitted.
8699:To deal with the problem of noisy channels, 802.11 allows frames to be fragmented into
8700-smaller pieces, each with its own checksum. The fragments are individually numbered and
8701-acknowledged using a stop-and-wait protocol (i.e., the sender may not transmit fragment k +
8702-1 until it has received the acknowledgment for fragment k). Once the channel has been
8703-acquired using RTS and CTS, multiple fragments can be sent in a row, as shown in Fig. 4-28.
8704-sequence of fragments is called a fragment burst.
8705-
8706-Figure 4-28. A fragment burst.
8707-223
8708-
8709-Fragmentation increases the throughput by restricting retransmissions to the bad fragments
8710-rather than the entire frame. The fragment size is not fixed by the standard but is a parameter
8711-of each cell and can be adjusted by the base station. The NAV mechanism keeps other stations
8712-quiet only until the next acknowledgement, but another mechanism (described below) is used
8713-to allow a whole fragment burst to be sent without interference.
8714:All of the above discussion applies to the 802.11 DCF mode. In this mode, there is no central
8715-control, and stations compete for air time, just as they do with Ethernet. The other allowed
8716-mode is PCF, in which the base station polls the other stations, asking them if they have any
8717-frames to send. Since transmission order is completely controlled by the base station in PCF
8718-mode, no collisions ever occur. The standard prescribes the mechanism for polling, but not the
8719-polling frequency, polling order, or even whether all stations need to get equal service.
8720-The basic mechanism is for the base station to broadcast a beacon frame periodically (10 to
8721-100 times per second). The beacon frame contains system parameters, such as hopping
8722-sequences and dwell times (for FHSS), clock synchronization, etc. It also invites new stations
8723-to sign up for polling service. Once a station has signed up for polling service at a certain rate,
8724-it is effectively guaranteed a certain fraction of the bandwidth, thus making it possible to give
8725-quality-of-service guarantees.
8726:Battery life is always an issue with mobile wireless devices, so 802.11 pays attention to the
8727-issue of power management. In particular, the base station can direct a mobile station to go
8728-into sleep state until explicitly awakened by the base station or the user. Having told a station
8729-to go to sleep, however, means that the base station has the responsibility for buffering any
8730-frames directed at it while the mobile station is asleep. These can be collected later.
8731-PCF and DCF can coexist within one cell. At first it might seem impossible to have central
8732:control and distributed control operating at the same time, but 802.11 provides a way to
8733-achieve this goal. It works by carefully defining the interframe time interval. After a frame has
8734-been sent, a certain amount of dead time is required before any station may send a frame.
8735-Four different intervals are defined, each for a specific purpose. The four intervals are depicted
8736-in Fig. 4-29.
8737-
8738:Figure 4-29. Interframe spacing in 802.11
8739-
8740-224
8741-
8742-The shortest interval is SIFS (Short InterFrame Spacing). It is used to allow the parties in a
8743-single dialog the chance to go first. This includes letting the receiver send a CTS to respond to
8744-an RTS, letting the receiver send an ACK for a fragment or full data frame, and letting the
8745-sender of a fragment burst transmit the next fragment without having to send an RTS again.
8746-There is always exactly one station that is entitled to respond after a SIFS interval. If it fails to
--
8753-any station may attempt to acquire the channel to send a new frame. The usual contention
8754-rules apply, and binary exponential backoff may be needed if a collision occurs.
8755-The last time interval, EIFS (Extended InterFrame Spacing), is used only by a station that
8756-has just received a bad or unknown frame to report the bad frame. The idea of giving this
8757-event the lowest priority is that since the receiver may have no idea of what is going on, it
8758-should wait a substantial time to avoid interfering with an ongoing dialog between two
8759-stations.
8760-
8761:4.4.4 The 802.11 Frame Structure
8762:The 802.11 standard defines three different classes of frames on the wire: data, control, and
8763-management. Each of these has a header with a variety of fields used within the MAC
8764-sublayer. In addition, there are some headers used by the physical layer but these mostly deal
8765-with the modulation techniques used, so we will not discuss them here.
8766-The format of the data frame is shown in Fig. 4-30. First comes the Frame Control field. It
8767-itself has 11 subfields. The first of these is the Protocol version, which allows two versions of
8768-the protocol to operate at the same time in the same cell. Then come the Type (data, control,
8769-or management) and Subtype fields (e.g., RTS or CTS). The To DS and From DS bits indicate
8770-the frame is going to or coming from the intercell distribution system (e.g., Ethernet). The MF
8771-bit means that more fragments will follow. The Retry bit marks a retransmission of a frame
8772-sent earlier. The Power management bit is used by the base station to put the receiver into
8773-sleep state or take it out of sleep state. The More bit indicates that the sender has additional
8774-frames for the receiver. The W bit specifies that the frame body has been encrypted using the
8775-WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) algorithm. Finally, the O bit tells the receiver that a
8776-sequence of frames with this bit on must be processed strictly in order.
8777-
8778:Figure 4-30. The 802.11 data frame.
8779-
8780-225
8781-
8782-The second field of the data frame, the Duration field, tells how long the frame and its
8783-acknowledgement will occupy the channel. This field is also present in the control frames and
8784-is how other stations manage the NAV mechanism. The frame header contains four addresses,
8785-all in standard IEEE 802 format. The source and destination are obviously needed, but what
8786-are the other two for? Remember that frames may enter or leave a cell via a base station. The
--
8789-frame and 4 identify the fragment. The Data field contains the payload, up to 2312 bytes,
8790-followed by the usual Checksum.
8791-Management frames have a format similar to that of data frames, except without one of the
8792-base station addresses, because management frames are restricted to a single cell. Control
8793-frames are shorter still, having only one or two addresses, no Data field, and no Sequence
8794-field. The key information here is in the Subtype field, usually RTS, CTS, or ACK.
8795-
8796-4.4.5 Services
8797:The 802.11 standard states that each conformant wireless LAN must provide nine services.
8798-These services are divided into two categories: five distribution services and four station
8799-services. The distribution services relate to managing cell membership and interacting with
8800-stations outside the cell. In contrast, the station services relate to activity within a single cell.
8801-The five distribution services are provided by the base stations and deal with station mobility
8802-as they enter and leave cells, attaching themselves to and detaching themselves from base
8803-stations. They are as follows.
8804-1. Association. This service is used by mobile stations to connect themselves to base
8805-stations. Typically, it is used just after a station moves within the radio range of the
--
8807-include the data rates supported, need for PCF services (i.e., polling), and power
8808-management requirements. The base station may accept or reject the mobile station. If
8809-the mobile station is accepted, it must then authenticate itself.
8810-2. Disassociation. Either the station or the base station may disassociate, thus breaking
8811-the relationship. A station should use this service before shutting down or leaving, but
8812-the base station may also use it before going down for maintenance.
8813-3. Reassociation. A station may change its preferred base station using this service. This
8814-facility is useful for mobile stations moving from one cell to another. If it is used
8815:correctly, no data will be lost as a consequence of the handover. (But 802.11, like
8816-Ethernet, is just a best-efforts service.)
8817-4. Distribution. This service determines how to route frames sent to the base station. If
8818-the destination is local to the base station, the frames can be sent out directly over the
8819-air. Otherwise, they will have to be forwarded over the wired network.
8820:5. Integration. If a frame needs to be sent through a non-802.11 network with a
8821-different addressing scheme or frame format, this service handles the translation from
8822:the 802.11 format to the format required by the destination network.
8823-
8824-226
8825-
8826-The remaining four services are intracell (i.e., relate to actions within a single cell). They are
8827-used after association has taken place and are as follows.
8828-1. Authentication. Because wireless communication can easily be sent or received by
8829-unauthorized stations, a station must authenticate itself before it is permitted to send
8830-data. After a mobile station has been associated by the base station (i.e., accepted into
--
8835-initial standard, the base station does not have to prove its identity to the mobile
8836-station, but work to repair this defect in the standard is underway.
8837-2. Deauthentication. When a previously authenticated station wants to leave the
8838-network, it is deauthenticated. After deauthentication, it may no longer use the
8839-network.
8840-3. Privacy. For information sent over a wireless LAN to be kept confidential, it must be
8841-encrypted. This service manages the encryption and decryption. The encryption
8842-algorithm specified is RC4, invented by Ronald Rivest of M.I.T.
8843:4. Data delivery. Finally, data transmission is what it is all about, so 802.11 naturally
8844:provides a way to transmit and receive data. Since 802.11 is modeled on Ethernet and
8845-transmission over Ethernet is not guaranteed to be 100% reliable, transmission over
8846:802.11 is not guaranteed to be reliable either. Higher layers must deal with detecting
8847-and correcting errors.
8848:An 802.11 cell has some parameters that can be inspected and, in some cases, adjusted. They
8849-relate to encryption, timeout intervals, data rates, beacon frequency, and so on.
8850-
8851:Wireless LANs based on 802.11 are starting to be deployed in office buildings, airports, hotels,
8852-restaurants, and campuses around the world. Rapid growth is expected. For some experience about
8853:the widespread deployment of 802.11 at CMU, see (Hills, 2001).
8854-
8855-4.5 Broadband Wireless
8856-We have been indoors too long. Let us now go outside and see if any interesting networking is
8857-going on there. It turns out that quite a bit is going on there, and some of it has to do with the
8858-so-called last mile. With the deregulation of the telephone system in many countries,
8859-competitors to the entrenched telephone company are now often allowed to offer local voice
8860-and high-speed Internet service. There is certainly plenty of demand. The problem is that
8861-running fiber, coax, or even category 5 twisted pair to millions of homes and businesses is
--
8879-these terms as interchangeable.
8880-Like some of the other 802 standards, 802.16 was heavily influenced by the OSI model,
8881-including the (sub)layers, terminology, service primitives, and more. Unfortunately, also like
8882-OSI, it is fairly complicated. In the following sections we will give a brief description of some of
8883-the highlights of 802.16, but this treatment is far from complete and leaves out many details.
8884-For additional information about broadband wireless in general, see (Bolcskei et al., 2001; and
8885-Webb, 2001). For information about 802.16 in particular, see (Eklund et al., 2002).
8886-
8887:4.5.1 Comparison of 802.11 with 802.16
8888:At this point you may be thinking: Why devise a new standard? Why not just use 802.11?
8889:There are some very good reasons for not using 802.11, primarily because 802.11 and 802.16
8890-solve different problems. Before getting into the technology of 802.16, it is probably
8891-worthwhile saying a few words about why a new standard is needed at all.
8892:The environments in which 802.11 and 802.16 operate are similar in some ways, primarily in
8893-that they were designed to provide high-bandwidth wireless communications. But they also
8894-differ in some major ways. To start with, 802.16 provides service to buildings, and buildings
8895:are not mobile. They do not migrate from cell to cell often. Much of 802.11 deals with mobility,
8896-and none of that is relevant here. Next, buildings can have more than one computer in them, a
8897-complication that does not occur when the end station is a single notebook computer. Because
8898-building owners are generally willing to spend much more money for communication gear than
8899-are notebook owners, better radios are available. This difference means that 802.16 can use
8900:full-duplex communication, something 802.11 avoids to keep the cost of the radios low.
8901-Because 802.16 runs over part of a city, the distances involved can be several kilometers,
8902-which means that the perceived power at the base station can vary widely from station to
8903-station. This variation affects the signal-to-noise ratio, which, in, turn, dictates multiple
8904-modulation schemes. Also, open communication over a city means that security and privacy
8905-are essential and mandatory.
8906:Furthermore, each cell is likely to have many more users than will a typical 802.11 cell, and
8907:these users are expected to use more bandwidth than will a typical 802.11 user. After all it is
8908-rare for a company to invite 50 employees to show up in a room with their laptops to see if
8909:they can saturate the 802.11 wireless network by watching 50 separate movies at once. For
8910-this reason, more spectrum is needed than the ISM bands can provide, forcing 802.16 to
8911-operate in the much higher 10-to-66 GHz frequency range, the only place unused spectrum is
8912-still available.
8913-But these millimeter waves have different physical properties than the longer waves in the ISM
8914-bands, which in turn requires a completely different physical layer. One property that
8915-millimeter waves have is that they are strongly absorbed by water (especially rain, but to
8916-some extent also by snow, hail, and with a bit of bad luck, heavy fog). Consequently, error
8917-handling is more important than in an indoor environment. Millimeter waves can be focused
8918:into directional beams (802.11 is omnidirectional), so choices made in 802.11 relating to
8919-multipath propagation are moot here.
8920:Another issue is quality of service. While 802.11 provides some support for real-time traffic
8921-(using PCF mode), it was not really designed for telephony and heavy-duty multimedia usage.
8922-In contrast, 802.16 is expected to support these applications completely because it is intended
8923-for residential as well as business use.
8924:In short, 802.11 was designed to be mobile Ethernet, whereas 802.16 was designed to be
8925-wireless, but stationary, cable television. These differences are so big that the resulting
8926-standards are very different as they try to optimize different things.
8927-228
8928-
8929-A very brief comparison with the cellular phone system is also worthwhile. With mobile phones,
8930-we are talking about narrow-band, voice-oriented, low-powered, mobile stations that
8931-communicate using medium-length microwaves. Nobody watches high-resolution, two-hour
8932-movies on GSM mobile phones (yet). Even UMTS has little hope of changing this situation. In
--
8935-future is an interesting question. It was not optimized for them, but the possibility is there. For
8936-the moment it is focused on fixed wireless.
8937-
8938-4.5.2 The 802.16 Protocol Stack
8939-The 802.16 protocol stack is illustrated in Fig. 4-31. The general structure is similar to that of
8940-the other 802 networks, but with more sublayers. The bottom sublayer deals with
8941-transmission. Traditional narrow-band radio is used with conventional modulation schemes.
8942-Above the physical transmission layer comes a convergence sublayer to hide the different
8943:technologies from the data link layer. Actually, 802.11 has something like this too, only the
8944-committee chose not to formalize it with an OSI-type name.
8945-
8946-Figure 4-31. The 802.16 protocol stack.
8947-
8948-Although we have not shown them in the figure, work is already underway to add two new
8949-physical layer protocols. The 802.16a standard will support OFDM in the 2-to-11 GHz
8950-frequency range. The 802.16b standard will operate in the 5-GHz ISM band. Both of these are
8951:attempts to move closer to 802.11.
8952-The data link layer consists of three sublayers. The bottom one deals with privacy and security,
8953-which is far more crucial for public outdoor networks than for private indoor networks. It
8954-manages encryption, decryption, and key management.
8955-Next comes the MAC sublayer common part. This is where the main protocols, such as channel
8956-management, are located. The model is that the base station controls the system. It can
8957-schedule the downstream (i.e., base to subscriber) channels very efficiently and plays a major
8958-role in managing the upstream (i.e., subscriber to base) channels as well. An unusual feature
8959-of the MAC sublayer is that, unlike those of the other 802 networks, it is completely connection

9054-4. Best-efforts service.
9055-All service in 802.16 is connection-oriented, and each connection gets one of the above classes
9056-of service, determined when the connection is set up. This design is very different from that of
9057:802.11 or Ethernet, which have no connections in the MAC sublayer.
9058-Constant bit rate service is intended for transmitting uncompressed voice such as on a T1
9059-channel. This service needs to send a predetermined amount of data at predetermined time
9060-intervals. It is accommodated by dedicating certain time slots to each connection of this type.
9061-Once the bandwidth has been allocated, the time slots are available automatically, without the
9062-need to ask for each one.
9063-Real-time variable bit rate service is for compressed multimedia and other soft real-time
9064-applications in which the amount of bandwidth needed each instant may vary. It is
9065-accommodated by the base station polling the subscriber at a fixed interval to ask how much
--
9114-other devices (e.g., PDAs) without cables. Together with four other companies (IBM, Intel,
9115-Nokia, and Toshiba), it formed a SIG (Special Interest Group, i.e., consortium) to develop a
9116-wireless standard for interconnecting computing and communication devices and accessories
9117-using short-range, low-power, inexpensive wireless radios. The project was named Bluetooth,
9118-after Harald Blaatand (Bluetooth) II (940-981), a Viking king who unified (i.e., conquered)
9119-Denmark and Norway, also without cables.
9120-Although the original idea was just to get rid of the cables between devices, it soon began to
9121-expand in scope and encroach on the area of wireless LANs. While this move makes the
9122:standard more useful, it also creates some competition for mindshare with 802.11. To make
9123-matters worse, the two systems also interfere with each other electrically. It is also worth
9124-noting that Hewlett-Packard introduced an infrared network for connecting computer
9125-peripherals without wires some years ago, but it never really caught on in a big way.
9126-Undaunted by all this, in July 1999 the Bluetooth SIG issued a 1500-page specification of V1.0.
9127-Shortly thereafter, the IEEE standards group looking at wireless personal area networks,
9128-802.15, adopted the Bluetooth document as a basis and began hacking on it. While it might
9129-seem strange to standardize something that already had a very detailed specification and no
9130-incompatible implementations that needed to be harmonized, history shows that having an
--
9156-implementation of complete Bluetooth chips for under $5. The consequence of this decision is
9157-that the slaves are fairly dumb, basically just doing whatever the master tells them to do. At
9158-its heart, a piconet is a centralized TDM system, with the master controlling the clock and
9159-determining which device gets to communicate in which time slot. All communication is
9160-between the master and a slave; direct slave-slave communication is not possible.
9161-
9162-4.6.2 Bluetooth Applications
9163-Most network protocols just provide channels between communicating entities and let
9164:applications designers figure out what they want to use them for. For example, 802.11 does
9165-not specify whether users should use their notebook computers for reading e-mail, surfing the
9166-Web, or something else. In contrast, the Bluetooth V1.1 specification names 13 specific
9167-applications to be supported and provides different protocol stacks for each one. Unfortunately,
9168-this approach leads to a very large amount of complexity, which we will omit here. The 13
9169-applications, which are called profiles, are listed in Fig. 4-36. By looking at them briefly now,
9170-we may see more clearly what the Bluetooth SIG is trying to accomplish.
9171-
9172-Figure 4-36. The Bluetooth profiles.
--
9180-Bluetooth devices are expected to implement these two profiles. The remaining ones are
9181-optional.
9182-The serial port profile is a transport protocol that most of the remaining profiles use. It
9183-emulates a serial line and is especially useful for legacy applications that expect a serial line.
9184-The generic object exchange profile defines a client-server relationship for moving data
9185-around. Clients initiate operations, but a slave can be either a client or a server. Like the serial
9186-port profile, it is a building block for other profiles.
9187-The next group of three profiles is for networking. The LAN access profile allows a Bluetooth
9188:device to connect to a fixed network. This profile is a direct competitor to 802.11. The dial-up
9189-networking profile was the original motivation for the whole project. It allows a notebook
9190-computer to connect to a mobile phone containing a built-in modem without wires. The fax
9191-profile is similar to dial-up networking, except that it allows wireless fax machines to send and
9192-receive faxes using mobile phones without a wire between the two.
9193-The next three profiles are for telephony. The cordless telephony profile provides a way to
9194-connect the handset of a cordless telephone to the base station. Currently, most cordless
9195-telephones cannot also be used as mobile phones, but in the future, cordless and mobile
9196-phones may merge. The intercom profile allows two telephones to connect as walkie-talkies.
--
9255-4.6.4 The Bluetooth Radio Layer
9256-The radio layer moves the bits from master to slave, or vice versa. It is a low-power system
9257-with a range of 10 meters operating in the 2.4-GHz ISM band. The band is divided into 79
9258-channels of 1 MHz each. Modulation is frequency shift keying, with 1 bit per Hz giving a gross
9259-data rate of 1 Mbps, but much of this spectrum is consumed by overhead. To allocate the
9260-channels fairly, frequency hopping spread spectrum is used with 1600 hops/sec and a dwell
9261-time of 625 µsec. All the nodes in a piconet hop simultaneously, with the master dictating the
9262-hop sequence.
9263:Because both 802.11 and Bluetooth operate in the 2.4-GHz ISM band on the same 79
9264:channels, they interfere with each other. Since Bluetooth hops far faster than 802.11, it is far
9265:more likely that a Bluetooth device will ruin 802.11 transmissions than the other way around.
9266:Since 802.11 and 802.15 are both IEEE standards, IEEE is looking for a solution to this
9267-problem, but it is not so easy to find since both systems use the ISM band for the same
9268:reason: no license is required there. The 802.11a standard uses the other (5 GHz) ISM band,
9269:but it has a much shorter range than 802.11b (due to the physics of radio waves), so using
9270:802.11a is not a perfect solution for all cases. Some companies have solved the problem by
9271-banning Bluetooth altogether. A market-based solution is for the network with more power
9272-(politically and economically, not electrically) to demand that the weaker party modify its
9273-standard to stop interfering with it. Some thoughts on this matter are given in (Lansford et al.,
9274-2001).
9275-
9276-4.6.5 The Bluetooth Baseband Layer
9277-The baseband layer is the closest thing Bluetooth has to a MAC sublayer. It turns the raw bit
9278-stream into frames and defines some key formats. In the simplest form, the master in each
--
9411-Ideally, bridges should be fully transparent, meaning it should be possible to move a machine
9412-from one cable segment to another without changing any hardware, software, or configuration
9413-tables. Also, it should be possible for machines on any segment to communicate with machines
9414-on any other segment without regard to the types of LANs being used on the two segments or
9415-on segments in between them. This goal is sometimes achieved, but not always.
9416-
9417-4.7.1 Bridges from 802.x to 802.y
9418-Having seen why bridges are needed, let us now turn to the question of how they work. Figure
9419:4-40 illustrates the operation of a simple two-port bridge. Host A on a wireless (802.11) LAN
9420-has a packet to send to a fixed host, B, on an (802.3) Ethernet to which the wireless LAN is
9421-connected. The packet descends into the LLC sublayer and acquires an LLC header (shown in
9422:black in the figure). Then it passes into the MAC sublayer and an 802.11 header is prepended
9423-to it (also a trailer, not shown in the figure). This unit goes out over the air and is picked up by
9424-the base station, which sees that it needs to go to the fixed Ethernet. When it hits the bridge
9425:connecting the 802.11 network to the 802.3 network, it starts in the physical layer and works
9426-240
9427-
9428:its way upward. In the MAC sublayer in the bridge, the 802.11 header is stripped off. The bare
9429-packet (with LLC header) is then handed off to the LLC sublayer in the bridge. In this example,
9430-the packet is destined for an 802.3 LAN, so it works its way down the 802.3 side of the bridge
9431-and off it goes on the Ethernet. Note that a bridge connecting k different LANs will have k
9432-different MAC sublayers and k different physical layers, one for each type.
9433-
9434:Figure 4-40. Operation of a LAN bridge from 802.11 to 802.3.
9435-
9436-So far it looks like moving a frame from one LAN to another is easy. Such is not the case. In
9437-this section we will point out some of the difficulties that one encounters when trying to build a
9438:bridge between the various 802 LANs (and MANs). We will focus on 802.3, 802.11, and
9439-802.16, but there are others as well, each with its unique problems.
9440-To start with, each of the LANs uses a different frame format (see Fig. 4-41). Unlike the
9441-differences between Ethernet, token bus, and token ring, which were due to history and big
9442-corporate egos, here the differences are to some extent legitimate. For example, the Duration
9443:field in 802.11 is there due to the MACAW protocol and makes no sense in Ethernet. As a
9444-result, any copying between different LANs requires reformatting, which takes CPU time,
9445-requires a new checksum calculation, and introduces the possibility of undetected errors due to
9446-bad bits in the bridge's memory.
9447-
9448-Figure 4-41. The IEEE 802 frame formats. The drawing is not to scale.
9449-
9450-A second problem is that interconnected LANs do not necessarily run at the same data rate.
9451-When forwarding a long run of back-to-back frames from a fast LAN to a slower one, the
9452-bridge will not be able to get rid of the frames as fast as they come in. For example, if a
9453:gigabit Ethernet is pouring bits into an 11-Mbps 802.11b LAN at top speed, the bridge will
9454-have to buffer them, hoping not to run out of memory. Bridges that connect three or more
9455-
9456-241
9457-
9458-LANs have a similar problem when several LANs are trying to feed the same output LAN at the
9459-same time even if all the LANs run at the same speed.
9460-A third problem, and potentially the most serious of all, is that different 802 LANs have
9461-different maximum frame lengths. An obvious problem arises when a long frame must be
9462-forwarded onto a LAN that cannot accept it. Splitting the frame into pieces is out of the
9463-question in this layer. All the protocols assume that frames either arrive or they do not. There
9464-is no provision for reassembling frames out of smaller units. This is not to say that such
9465-protocols could not be devised. They could be and have been. It is just that no data link
9466-protocols provide this feature, so bridges must keep their hands off the frame payload.
9467-Basically, there is no solution. Frames that are too large to be forwarded must be discarded.
9468-So much for transparency.
9469:Another point is security. Both 802.11 and 802.16 support encryption in the data link layer.
9470-Ethernet does not. This means that the various encryption services available to the wireless
9471-networks are lost when traffic passes over an Ethernet. Worse yet, if a wireless station uses
9472-data link layer encryption, there will be no way to decrypt it when it arrives over an Ethernet.
9473-If the wireless station does not use encryption, its traffic will be exposed over the air link.
9474-Either way there is a problem.
9475:One solution to the security problem is to do encryption in a higher layer, but then the 802.11
9476:station has to know whether it is talking to another station on an 802.11 network (meaning
9477-use data link layer encryption) or not (meaning do not use it). Forcing the station to make a
9478-choice destroys transparency.
9479:A final point is quality of service. Both 802.11 and 802.16 provide it in various forms, the
9480-former using PCF mode and the latter using constant bit rate connections. Ethernet has no
9481-concept of quality of service, so traffic from either of the others will lose its quality of service
9482-when passing over an Ethernet.
9483-
9484-4.7.2 Local Internetworking
9485-The previous section dealt with the problems encountered in connecting two different IEEE 802
9486-LANs via a single bridge. However, in large organizations with many LANs, just interconnecting
9487-them all raises a variety of issues, even if they are all just Ethernet. Ideally, it should be
--
9838-pooh-pooh this argument saying that its switches understand both IPv4 and IPv6, so
9839-everything is fine. But what happens when IPv7 happens? The vendor would probably say: Buy
9840-new switches, is that so bad?
9841-
9842-The IEEE 802.1Q Standard
9843-Some more thought on this subject reveals that what actually matters is the VLAN of the frame
9844-itself, not the VLAN of the sending machine. If there were some way to identify the VLAN in
9845-the frame header, then the need to inspect the payload would vanish. For a new LAN, such as
9846:802.11 or 802.16, it would have been easy enough to just add a VLAN field in the header. In
9847-fact, the Connection Identifier field in 802.16 is somewhat similar in spirit to a VLAN identifier.
9848-But what to do about Ethernet, which is the dominant LAN, and does not have any spare fields
9849-lying around for the VLAN identifier?
9850-The IEEE 802 committee had this problem thrown into its lap in 1995. After much discussion, it
9851-did the unthinkable and changed the Ethernet header. The new format was published in IEEE
9852-standard 802.1Q, issued in 1998. The new format contains a VLAN tag; we will examine it
9853-shortly. Not surprisingly, changing something as well established as the Ethernet header is not
9854-entirely trivial. A few questions that come to mind are:
--
9970-well known. Binary countdown completely eliminates contention. The tree walk protocol
9971-reduces it by dynamically dividing the stations into two disjoint groups, one of which is
9972-permitted to transmit and one of which is not. It tries to make the division in such a way that
9973-only one station that is ready to send is permitted to do so.
9974-Wireless LANs have their own problems and solutions. The biggest problem is caused by
9975-hidden stations, so CSMA does not work. One class of solutions, typified by MACA and MACAW,
9976-attempts to stimulate transmissions around the destination, to make CSMA work better.
9977-Frequency hopping spread spectrum and direct sequence spread spectrum are also used. IEEE
9978:802.11 combines CSMA and MACAW to produce CSMA/CA.
9979-Ethernet is the dominant form of local area networking. It uses CSMA/CD for channel
9980-allocation. Older versions used a cable that snaked from machine to machine, but now twisted
9981-pairs to hubs and switches are most common. Speeds have risen from 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps and
9982-are still rising.
9983-
9984-254
9985-
9986:Wireless LANs are becoming common, with 802.11 dominating the field. Its physical layer
9987-allows five different transmission modes, including infrared, various spread spectrum schemes,
9988-and a multichannel FDM system. It can operate with a base station in each cell, but it can also
9989-operate without one. The protocol is a variant of MACAW, with virtual carrier sensing.
9990-Wireless MANs are starting to appear. These are broadband systems that use radio to replace
9991-the last mile on telephone connections. Traditional narrowband modulation techniques are
9992-used. Quality of service is important, with the 802.16 standard defining four classes (constant
9993-bit rate, two variable bit rate, and one best efforts).
9994-The Bluetooth system is also wireless but aimed more at the desktop, for connecting headsets

11157-networks or MANETs (Mobile Ad hoc NETworks). Let us now examine them briefly. More
11158-information can be found in (Perkins, 2001).
11159-What makes ad hoc networks different from wired networks is that all the usual rules about
11160-fixed topologies, fixed and known neighbors, fixed relationship between IP address and
11161-location, and more are suddenly tossed out the window. Routers can come and go or appear in

12553-should not be surprising that as new hardware developments occur, new software will be
12554-created to fit the new hardware. For example, the average home now is like the average office
12555-ten years ago: it is full of computers that do not talk to one another. In the future, it may be
12556-commonplace for the telephone, the television set, and other appliances all to be networked
12557-together so that they can be controlled remotely. This new technology will undoubtedly bring
12558-new networks and new protocols.
12559-As an example of how different networks might be connected, consider the example of Fig. 542. Here we see a corporate network with multiple locations tied together by a wide area ATM
12560-network. At one of the locations, an FDDI optical backbone is used to connect an Ethernet, an
12561:802.11 wireless LAN, and the corporate data center's SNA mainframe network.
12562-

12565-The purpose of interconnecting all these networks is to allow users on any of them to
12566-communicate with users on all the other ones and also to allow users on any of them to access
12567-data on any of them. Accomplishing this goal means sending packets from one network to
12568-another. Since networks often differ in important ways, getting packets from one network to
12569-another is not always so easy, as we will now see.

12602-5.5.2 How Networks Can Be Connected
12603-Networks can be interconnected by different devices, as we saw in Chap 4. Let us briefly
12604-review that material. In the physical layer, networks can be connected by repeaters or hubs,
12605-which just move the bits from one network to an identical network. These are mostly analog
12606-devices and do not understand anything about digital protocols (they just regenerate signals).
12607-One layer up we find bridges and switches, which operate at the data link layer. They can
12608-accept frames, examine the MAC addresses, and forward the frames to a different network
12609-while doing minor protocol translation in the process, for example, from Ethernet to FDDI or to
12610:802.11.
12611-In the network layer, we have routers that can connect two networks. If two networks have
12612-dissimilar network layers, the router may be able to translate between the packet formats,
12613-

12615-

12617-protocols is called a multiprotocol router.

20736-defined in XML. The modules and some example tags are listed in Fig. 7-56. We have not gone
20737-over all the example tags, but more information can be found at www.w3.org.

20740-
20741-Despite the agreement on the use of XHTML Basic, a threat to WAP and i-mode is lurking in
20742:the air: 802.11. The second-generation wireless Web is supposed to run at 384 kbps, far
20743-better than the 9600 bps of the first generation, but far worse than the 11 Mbps or 54 Mbps
20744:offered by 802.11. Of course, 802.11 is not everywhere, but as more restaurants, hotels,
20745-stores, companies, airports, bus stations, museums, universities, hospitals, and other
20746-organizations decide to install base stations for their employees and customers, there may be
20747-enough coverage in urban areas that people are willing to walk a few blocks to sit down in an
20748:802.11-enabled fast food restaurant for a cup of coffee and an e-mail. Businesses may
20749:routinely put 802.11 logos next to the logos that show which credit cards they accept, and for
20750-the same reason: to attract customers. City maps (downloadable, naturally) may show
20751-covered areas in green and silent areas in red, so people can wander from base station to base
20752-station, like nomads trekking from oasis to oasis in the desert.
20753:Although fast food restaurants may be quick to install 802.11 base stations, farmers will

20759:devices that use 802.11 if they can pick up a signal and fall back to WAP if they cannot.
20760-
20761-7.4 Multimedia
20762-The wireless Web is an exciting new development, but it is not the only one. For many people,
20763-multimedia is the holy grail of networking. When the word is mentioned, both the propeller
20764-heads and the suits begin salivating as if on cue. The former see immense technical challenges
20765-in providing (interactive) video on demand to every home. The latter see equally immense
20766-profits in it. Since multimedia requires high bandwidth, getting it to work over fixed
20767-connections is hard enough. Even VHS-quality video over wireless is a few years away, so our
--
24338-setup is the system administrator who has to configure and manage the firewalls. To everyone
24339-else, it is like having a leased-line private network again. For more about VPNs, see (Brown,
24340-1999; and Izzo, 2000).
24341-
24342-8.6.4 Wireless Security
24343-It is surprisingly easy to design a system that is logically completely secure by using VPNs and
24344-firewalls, but that, in practice, leaks like a sieve. This situation can occur if some of the
24345-machines are wireless and use radio communication, which passes right over the firewall in
24346:both directions. The range of 802.11 networks is often a few hundred meters, so anyone who
24347-wants to spy on a company can simply drive into the employee parking lot in the morning,
24348:leave an 802.11-enabled notebook computer in the car to record everything it hears, and take
24349-off for the day. By late afternoon, the hard disk will be full of valuable goodies. Theoretically,
24350-this leakage is not supposed to happen. Theoretically, people are not supposed to rob banks,
24351-either.
24352-Much of the security problem can be traced to the manufacturers of wireless base stations
24353-(access points) trying to make their products user friendly. Usually, if the user takes the device
24354-out of the box and plugs it into the electrical power socket, it begins operating immediately—
24355-nearly always with no security at all, blurting secrets to everyone within radio range. If it is
24356-then plugged into an Ethernet, all the Ethernet traffic suddenly appears in the parking lot as
24357-well. Wireless is a snooper's dream come true: free data without having to do any work. It
24358-therefore goes without saying that security is even more important for wireless systems than
24359-for wired ones. In this section, we will look at some ways wireless networks handle security.
24360-Some additional information can be found in (Nichols and Lekkas, 2002).
24361:802.11 Security
24362:The 802.11 standard prescribes a data link-level security protocol called WEP (Wired
24363-Equivalent Privacy), which is designed to make the security of a wireless LAN as good as
24364-that of a wired LAN. Since the default for wired LANs is no security at all, this goal is easy to
24365-achieve, and WEP achieves it, as we shall see.
24366:When 802.11 security is enabled, each station has a secret key shared with the base station.
24367-How the keys are distributed is not specified by the standard. They could be preloaded by the
24368-manufacturer. They could be exchanged in advance over the wired network. Finally, either the
24369-base station or user machine could pick a random key and send it to the other one over the air
24370-encrypted with the other one's public key. Once established, keys generally remain stable for
24371-months or years.
24372-WEP encryption uses a stream cipher based on the RC4 algorithm. RC4 was designed by
24373-Ronald Rivest and kept secret until it leaked out and was posted to the Internet in 1994. As we
24374-have pointed out before, it is nearly impossible to keep algorithms secret, even when the goal
--
24391-
24392-While this approach looks good at first glance, a method for breaking it has already been
24393-published (Borisov et al., 2001). Below we will summarize their results. First of all, surprisingly
24394-many installations use the same shared key for all users, in which case each user can read all
24395-the other users' traffic. This is certainly equivalent to Ethernet, but it is not very secure.
24396-But even if each user has a distinct key, WEP can still be attacked. Since keys are generally
24397-stable for long periods of time, the WEP standard recommends (but does not mandate) that IV
24398-be changed on every packet to avoid the keystream reuse attack we discussed in Sec. 8.2.3.
24399:Unfortunately, many 802.11 cards for notebook computers reset IV to 0 when the card is
24400-inserted into the computer, and increment it by one on each packet sent. Since people often
24401-remove and reinsert these cards, packets with low IV values are common. If Trudy can collect
24402-several packets sent by the same user with the same IV value (which is itself sent in plaintext
24403-along with each packet), she can compute the XOR of two plaintext values and probably break
24404-the cipher that way.
24405:But even if the 802.11 card picks a random IV for each packet, the IVs are only 24 bits, so
24406-after 224 packets have been sent, they have to be reused. Worse yet, with randomly chosen
24407-IVs, the expected number of packets that have to be sent before the same one is used twice is
24408-about 5000, due to the birthday attack described in Sec. 8.4.4. Thus, if Trudy listens for a few
24409-minutes, she is almost sure to capture two packets with the same IV and same key. By XORing
24410-the ciphertexts she is able to obtain the XOR of the plaintexts. This bit sequence can be
24411-attacked in various ways to recover the plaintexts. With some more work, the keystream for
24412-that IV can also be obtained. Trudy can continue working like this for a while and compile a
24413-dictionary of keystreams for various IVs. Once an IV has been broken, all the packets sent with
--
24416-keystream) pair, she can use it to generate all the packets she wants to using it and thus
24417-actively interfere with communication. Theoretically, a receiver could notice that large numbers
24418-of packets suddenly all have the same IV, but (1) WEP allows this, and (2) nobody checks for
24419-this anyway.
24420-604
24421-
24422-Finally, the CRC is not worth much, since it is possible for Trudy to change the payload and
24423-make the corresponding change to the CRC, without even having to remove the encryption In
24424:short, breaking 802.11's security is fairly straightforward, and we have not even listed all the
24425-attacks Borisov et al. found.
24426-In August 2001, a month after the Borisov et al. paper was presented, another devastating
24427-attack on WEP was published (Fluhrer et al., 2001). This one found cryptographic weaknesses
24428-in RC4 itself. Fluhrer et al. discovered that many of the keys have the property that it is
24429-possible to derive some key bits from the keystream. If this attack is performed repeatedly, it
24430-is possible to derive the entire key with a modest amount of effort. Being somewhat
24431:theoretically inclined, Fluhrer et al. did not actually try to break any 802.11 LANs.
24432-In contrast, when a summer student and two researchers at AT&T Labs learned about the
24433-Fluhrer et al. attack, they decided to try it out for real (Stubblefield et al., 2002). Within a
24434:week they had broken their first 128-bit key on a production 802.11 LAN, and most of the
24435:week was actually devoted to looking for the cheapest 802.11 card they could find, getting
24436-permission to buy it, installing it, and testing it. The programming took only two hours.
24437-When they announced their results, CNN ran a story entitled ''Off-the-Shelf Hack Breaks
24438-Wireless Encryption,'' in which some industry gurus tried to pooh-pooh their results by saying
24439-what they had done was trivial, given the Fluhrer et al. results. While that remark is technically
24440-true, the fact remains that the combined efforts of these two teams demonstrated a fatal flaw
24441:in WEP and 802.11.
24442-On September 7, 2001, IEEE responded to the fact that WEP was now completely broken by
24443-issuing a short statement making six points that can be roughly summarized as follows:
24444-1.
24445-2.
24446-3.
24447-4.
24448-5.
24449-6.
24450-
24451-We told you that WEP security was no better than Ethernet's.
24452-A much bigger threat is forgetting to enable security at all.
24453-Try using some other security (e.g., transport layer security).
24454:The next version, 802.11i, will have better security.
24455:Future certification will mandate the use of 802.11i.
24456:We will try to figure out what to do until 802.11i arrives.
24457-
24458-We have gone through this story in some detail to make the point that getting security right is
24459-not easy, even for experts.
24460-Bluetooth Security
24461:Bluetooth has a considerably shorter range than 802.11, so it cannot be attacked from the
24462-parking lot, but security is still an issue here. For example, imagine that Alice's computer is
24463-equipped with a wireless Bluetooth keyboard. In the absence of security, if Trudy happened to
24464-be in the adjacent office, she could read everything Alice typed in, including all her outgoing email. She could also capture everything Alice's computer sent to the Bluetooth printer sitting
24465-next to it (e.g., incoming e-mail and confidential reports). Fortunately, Bluetooth has an
24466-elaborate security scheme to try to foil the world's Trudies. We will now summarize the main
24467-features of it below.
24468-Bluetooth has three security modes, ranging from nothing at all to full data encryption and
24469:integrity control. As with 802.11, if security is disabled (the default), there is no security. Most
24470-users have security turned off until a serious breach has occurred; then they turn it on. In the
24471-agricultural world, this approach is known as locking the barn door after the horse has
24472-escaped.
24473-Bluetooth provides security in multiple layers. In the physical layer, frequency hopping
24474-provides a tiny bit of security, but since any Bluetooth device that moves into a piconet has to
24475-be told the frequency hopping sequence, this sequence is obviously not a secret. The real
24476-605

24506-WAP 2.0 Security
24507-For the most part, the WAP Forum learned its lesson from having a nonstandard protocol stack
24508-in WAP 1.0. WAP 2.0 largely uses standard protocols in all layers. Security is no exception.
24509-Since it is IP based, it supports full use of IPsec in the network layer. In the transport layer,
24510-TCP connections can be protected by TLS, an IETF standard we will study later in this chapter.
24511-Higher still, it uses HTTP client authentication, as defined in RFC 2617. Application-layer crypto
24512-libraries provide for integrity control and nonrepudiation. All in all, since WAP 2.0 is based on
24513-well-known standards, there is a chance that its security services, in particular, privacy,
24514:authentication, integrity control, and nonrepudiation may fare better than 802.11 and
24515-Bluetooth security.
24516-
24517-8.7 Authentication Protocols
24518-Authentication is the technique by which a process verifies that its communication partner is
24519-who it is supposed to be and not an imposter. Verifying the identity of a remote process in the
24520-face of a malicious, active intruder is surprisingly difficult and requires complex protocols
24521-based on cryptography. In this section, we will study some of the many authentication
24522-protocols that are used on insecure computer networks.
--
25975-Public-key management can be done using certificates, which are documents that bind a
25976-principal to a public key. Certificates are signed by a trusted authority or by someone
25977-(recursively) approved by a trusted authority. The root of the chain has to be obtained in
25978-advance, but browsers generally have many root certificates built into them.
25979-These cryptographic tools can be used to secure network traffic. IPsec operates in the network
25980-layer, encrypting packet flows from host to host. Firewalls can screen traffic going into or out
25981-of an organization, often based on the protocol and port used. Virtual private networks can
25982-simulate an old leased-line network to provide certain desirable security properties. Finally,
25983:wireless networks need good security and 802.11's WEP does not provide it, although 802.11i
25984-should improve matters considerably.
25985-When two parties establish a session, they have to authenticate each other and if need be,
25986-establish a shared session key. Various authentication protocols exist, including some that use
25987-a trusted third party, Diffie-Hellman, Kerberos, and public-key cryptography.
25988-E-mail security can be achieved by a combination of the techniques we have studied in this
25989-chapter. PGP, for example, compresses messages, then encrypts them using IDEA. It sends
25990-the IDEA key encrypted with the receiver's public key. In addition, it also hashes the message
25991-and sends the signed hash to verify message integrity.
